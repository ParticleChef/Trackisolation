## TrackIsolation

# Main algorithm
In both directory, there are parameters from region of interest and signal windows from CMSSW6. 
Also, there are files which named "test" containing "PiXTRK + Track isolation" algorithm based on CMSSW6.

# Others
The rest codes are about measuring a function of transverse momentum and delta phi.
