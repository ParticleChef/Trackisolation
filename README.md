TrackIsolation
==============

This code is made to improve L1PixelTrigger for electron performance.

## CMSSW6 directory
In CMSSW6 directory, there are two folders. Signal directory contains codes to measure efficiency of L1PixelTrigger and Track isolation algorithm. <br>
Minbias directory contains codes to measure rate according to transverse energy threshold. Both codes worked in KISTI server.

## CMSSW9 directory
NOPU directory contains codes to measure signal windows for track isolation algorithm with SingleMuon without pile-up sample. Also it has a code for measurment of pixel detector barrels and disk. <br>
PtMeasure directory contains codes to find a function between deltaphi and transverse momentum. DeltaPhi is calculated between two vectors such as PVL1 - L1L2. <br>
SignalWindow directory has codes to measure signal windows for L1PixelTrigger algorithm
