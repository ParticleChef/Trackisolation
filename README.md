TrackIsolation
==============

This code is made to improve L1PixelTrigger for electron performance.

## CMSSW6 directory
In CMSSW6 directory, there are two folders. Signal directory contains codes to measure efficiency of L1PixelTrigger and Track isolation algorithm. 
Minbias directory contains codes to measure rate according to transverse energy threshold. Both codes worked in KISTI server.

## CMSSW9 directory
NOPU directory contains codes to measure signal windows for track isolation algorithm with SingleMuon without pile-up sample.
PtMeasure directory contains codes to find a function between deltaphi and transverse momentum. DeltaPhi is calculated between two vectors such as PVL1 - L1L2.
