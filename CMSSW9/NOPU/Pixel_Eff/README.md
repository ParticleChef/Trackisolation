Pixel detector efficiency measurement
=====================================

sw\_treeMaker code for electron!
<br>
test code for muon!
<br>

Both codes run with each NOPU sample based on CMSSW9 <br>

## Draw option
Root file has 'h1' histogram for background and efficiency graphs.
First of all draw h1 and use "PL same" option to draw in the same canvas.
